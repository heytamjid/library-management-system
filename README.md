# lib

The django project name is "**library2**"
so basically the direcory/respository should have been github.com/heytamjid/**library2** instead of github.com/heytamjid/**lib**

Now I've already submitted the assignment so cannot change the direcory... Please do it yourself in case you want to clone it and run on your machine.
